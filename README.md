# Speech_emotion_recognition
In this work i propose a speech emotion recognition model based on the extraction of four different features got from sound files and stackingthe resulting matrices in a one-dimensional array by taking the mean values along the time axis. Then this array is fed into a 1-D CNN model as input.
